/*
 -Where do you think you should place the function definition?
 Define in the Fraction implementation file and make it static.
 
 -Are there any benefits of making the function static?
 It cannot be accessed outside the file that doesn't need the code thus preventing any future errors (not sure).
 
 -Which approach do you think is better, using a gcd function or incorporating the code directly into the method as you did previously?
 Using a gcd function.
 
 -Why?
 Reusability. some methods other than "reduce" might need the "gcd" function thus reducing lines of codes
